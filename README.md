# UdemyCourse-DataScienceAtoZ
This course gave me a full overview of the Data Science journey. Upon completing this course I know:

    How to clean and prepare my data for analysis
    How to perform basic visualisation of my data
    How to model my data
    How to curve-fit my data
    And finally, how to present my findings and wow the audience

This course gave me so much practical exercises that real world seems like a piece of cake when I graduated this class. This course has homework exercises that are so thought provoking and challenging that I want to cry... But I didn't give up! I crushed them. In this course I developed a good understanding of the following tools:

    SQL
    SSIS
    Tableau
    Gretl
