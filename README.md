# Data Science A-Z - Real-Life Data Science Exercises Included

I gained a full overview of the Data Science journey. Corrupt data, anomalies, irregularities - you name it! Now I know:

    How to clean and prepare my data for analysis
    How to perform visualisation of my data
    How to model my data
    How to curve-fit my data
    And finally, how to present my findings and wow the audience

I practiced so much exercises that are so thought provoking and challenging that I wanted to cry... But I didn't give up! I crushed them. I developed a good understanding of the following tools:

    SQL using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
    Microsoft Power BI tool SSIS
    Tableau

I have created interactive Tableau dashboards and storylines. View my stunning Tableau creations on Tableau Public Profile https://public.tableau.com/profile/thilakshasilva.

I experienced how to successfully perform all the steps in a complex Data Science project:
