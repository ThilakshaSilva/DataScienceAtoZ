# Data Science A-Z - Real-Life Data Science Exercises Included

I gained a full overview of the Data Science journey. Now I know:

    How to clean and prepare my data for analysis
    How to perform visualisation of my data
    How to model my data
    How to curve-fit my data
    And finally, how to present my findings and wow the audience

I practiced so much exercises that are so thought provoking and challenging that I wanted to cry... But I didn't give up! I crushed them. I developed a good understanding of the following tools:

    SQL
    SSIS
    Tableau
    Gretl
